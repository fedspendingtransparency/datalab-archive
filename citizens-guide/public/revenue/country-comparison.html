        <h1>Compare the Revenue of the United States to other Countries</h1>

<div class="tighter-text">
    <p>The chart below shows total revenue collected by the U.S. government compared to 171 other countries in 2017. In that same year, the government collected $3.3 trillion, which is equivalent to 17% of GDP.</p>
    <p>How does the U.S. compare to other countries? We encourage you to check out the chart below. You can compare total revenue (in dollars) and revenue as a percent of GDP. Pick a country of interest and see for yourself.</p>

    <p>The visualization was created using the <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/mthTreasStmt/mts0917.pdf" target="_blank">Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS)</a> as the data source for federal government revenue of the United States. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures for the United States come from the <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product" target="_blank">Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)</a>.

    <p>In researching potential data sources for information on the revenue of other governments for the country comparison module, the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2056.html" target="_blank">CIA World Factbook</a> was chosen because it provides the best comparison of federal revenue by country for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the volume of countries with 2017 data,</li>
        <li>relative consistency with the level of government measured (central government only as a standard),</li>
        <li>all figures expressed in US dollars</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Countries without 2017 data were excluded from the country comparison data set. Although most countries in the data set feature revenue from central government sources only, some countries included state/provincial/local revenue. As a result, this visualization should not be considered an absolute comparison of the revenue of central governments for all countries.</p>
    <p>To finish the data set for Country Comparison, GDP figures from BEA and the IMF WEOD were combined with revenue figures from the CIA World Factbook data set, excluding countries that were not available from both sources.</p>
