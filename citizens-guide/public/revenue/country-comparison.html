        <h1>Compare the Revenue of the United States to other Countries</h1>

<div class="tighter-text">
    <p>The chart below shows total revenue collected by the U.S. government compared to 171 other countries in 2018. In 2018, the United States collected $3.3 trillion. That $3.3 trillion in revenue collected was equivalent to 16% of U.S. gross domestic product for 2018.</p>
    <p>How does the U.S. compare to other countries? We encourage you to check out the chart below. You can compare total revenue (in dollars) and revenue as a percent of gross domestic product. Find a country of interest and see for yourself. </p>

    <p>The visualization was created using the <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/mts/mts0918.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS)</a> as the data source for federal government revenue of the United States.

    <p>In researching potential data sources for information on the revenue of other governments for the country comparison module, the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2056.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIA World Factbook</a> was chosen because it provides the best comparison of federal revenue by country for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the volume of countries with 2017 data,</li>
        <li>relative consistency with the level of government measured (central government only as a standard),</li>
        <li>all figures expressed in US dollars</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Countries with figures before 2017 were excluded from the country comparison data set. Although most countries in the data set feature revenue from central government sources only, some countries included state/provincial/local revenue. As a result, this visualization should not be considered an absolute comparison of the revenue of central governments for all countries.</p>
    <p>To finish the data set for Country Comparison, gross domestic product figures from BEA and the IMF WEOD were combined with revenue figures from the CIA World Factbook data set, excluding countries that were not available from both sources.</p>
