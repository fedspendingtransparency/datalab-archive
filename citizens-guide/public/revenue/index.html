                <h1>In Fiscal Year 2018, federal revenue was equal to 16% of the total Gross Domestic Product, or economic activity, of the United States that year ($20.7 trillion).</h1>
                <p>Why do we compare federal revenue to gross domestic product? Federal taxes are based on a percentage of income for people and businesses. If an economy is performing well, people and businesses earn more, and revenue from taxes increase. In most cases, taxes are related to economic activity. As gross domestic product grows, tax revenue tends to increase as well.</p>
