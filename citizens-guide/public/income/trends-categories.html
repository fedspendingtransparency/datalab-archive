        This analysis was conducted using the <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/mthTreasStmt/mts0917.pdf" target="_blank">Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS)</a> as the data source for federal government income of the United States. <a href="https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?bls" target="_blank">The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers</a> was used to adjust income in fiscal years 2013-2016 for inflation. Adjusting for inflation allows users to see real, not nominal, changes in sources of income over time.
