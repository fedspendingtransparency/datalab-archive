    <p>Where does all the money go? Most of government spending is concentrated on programs that ensure the health and well-being of the people of the United States. Why does the federal government do this? One reason is the Constitution! The Constitution’s preamble, which outlines the purpose of creating the new government is "...to establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity."</p>

                <h1>In Fiscal Year 2018, federal spending was equal to 20% of the total Gross Domestic Product, or economic activity, of the United States that year ($20.7 trillion).</h1>
                
                <p>Why do we compare federal spending to GDP? One reason is to give a reference point for the size of the federal government, as measured by the amount it spends. The U.S. GDP is much larger than government spending, because it includes all the economic activity of the entire nation. Government spending equates to roughly 1 out of every 5 dollars transacted in a year.</p>

    <p>How much is $4.1 trillion in federal spending?

    <p><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong> measures the size of the nation's economy by the total value of goods and services that are produced in a year. GDP is used to compare the economies of different countries, measure growth in the economy, and determine the right monetary policies to address inflation and unemployment.</p>
