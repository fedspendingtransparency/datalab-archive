            <h1 class="accordion__heading">What are mandatory and discretionary spending?</h1>
            <div class="accordion__content">
                <p>The difference between mandatory and discretionary spending comes down to whether spending for a certain purpose is dictated by prior law or voted on in the annual appropriations process.  Programs like Social Security, Medicare and various income security programs, are based on laws previously established that dictate the money budgeted for spending each year, which is why spending for those programs is referred to as mandatory.</p>
                <p>Discretionary spending is money formally approved by the President and voted on by Congress during the appropriations process each year. Most of the discretionary spending is budgeted towards national defense. The rest of discretionary spending is budgeted to other federal agency programs ranging from transportation, education, housing and social service programs, to science and environmental organizations.</p>

        <p>This visualization was created using the Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS) as the data source for federal government spending of the United States by federal agency and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Historical Tables as the data source for federal government spending by spending type. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) was used to adjust spending in fiscal years 2013-2016 for inflation. Adjusting for inflation allows users to see real, not nominal, changes in sources in spending over time.</p>
