     <p>This visualization was created using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/mts/mts0918.pdf">Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS)</a> as the data source for federal government spending of the United States by federal agency and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Historical Tables as the data source for federal government spending by spending type. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) was used to adjust spending in fiscal years 2013-2016 for inflation. Adjusting for inflation allows users to see real, not nominal, changes in sources in spending over time.</p>
