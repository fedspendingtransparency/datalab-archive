            Your Guide to America's Finances is an overview of federal government finances in 2018, providing
            information on spending, revenue, the deficit, and debt. The Guide, which is created by Treasury's Data Lab,
            presents a series of interactive visualizations to allow you to explore these categories and how they have
            changed over time. Ultimately, the Guide seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the trillions of
            dollars collected and spent by the federal government each year.

            provide information about which regions are similar to others based on their homeless populations and
