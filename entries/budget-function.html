title: Data Lab – Budget Function – U.S. Treasury
excerpt: Do you know what the government spends money on in support of its main functions? Budget Functions are categories that describe the purpose of federal spending (the why), and Object Classes are categories that describe what goods and services were purchased (the what). This visualization will shed light on both categories and help you draw connections between them.
description: The U.S. Treasury’s Data Lab presents an analysis on federal spending related to the government’s main functions. This visualization sheds light on both budget functions and object classes.
