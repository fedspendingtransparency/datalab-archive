    The visualization was created using <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/mthTreasStmt/mts0917.pdf" target="_blank">Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS)</a> as the data source for federal government revenue of the United States. <a href="https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?bls" target="_blank">The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)</a> was used to adjust revenue in fiscal years 2013-2016 for inflation. Adjusting for inflation allows users to see real, not nominal, changes in sources of revenue over time.
