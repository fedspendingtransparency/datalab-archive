        <p>The visualization was created using the {% include ffg/data-sources/country_comparison_mts.html %} as the data source for federal government revenue of the United States. Gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the United States come from the {% include ffg/data-sources/bea_gdp.html %}. GDP data for countries other than the United States comes from the {% include ffg/data-sources/imf_gdp.html %}.</p>
        <p>In researching potential data sources for information on the revenue of other governments for the country comparison module, we chose the {% include ffg/data-sources/cia_world_factbook.html %} because it provides the best comparison for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the number of countries with {% include ffg/data-sources/country_comparison_fy.html %} data,</li>
            <li>relative consistency with the level of government measured (central government only as a standard),</li>
            <li>all figures expressed in US dollars.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Countries with figures before {% include ffg/data-sources/country_comparison_fy.html %} were excluded from the country comparison data set. Although most countries in the data set feature revenue from central government sources only, some countries included state/provincial/local revenue. As a result, this visualization should not be considered an absolute comparison of the revenue of central governments for all countries.</p>
        <p>To finish the data set for Country Comparison, gross domestic product figures from BEA and the IMF WEOD were combined with revenue figures from the CIA World Factbook data set, excluding countries that did not have data available from both sources.</p>
