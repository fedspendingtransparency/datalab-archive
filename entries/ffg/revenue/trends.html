        The visualization was created using {% include ffg/data-sources/mts_homepage.html %} as the data source for federal government revenue of the United States. Some categories from the MTS have been renamed in order to be more easily understood. {% include ffg/data-sources/bls_cpiu.html %} was used to adjust revenue in fiscal years {% include ffg/data-sources/inflation_fys.html %} for inflation. Adjusting for inflation allows users to see real, not nominal, changes in sources of revenue over time.
