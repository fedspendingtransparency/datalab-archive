                    <h1>In Fiscal Year 2018, federal revenue was equal to 16% of total gross domestic product (GDP), or economic activity, of the United States that year ($20.7 trillion).</h1>
                    <p>Why do we compare federal revenue to gross domestic product? For one, the comparison serves as a rough gauge of the size of the federal government's footprint related to size of the entire country's economic activity. In addition, federal taxes are based on a percentage of income for people and businesses. If an economy is performing well, people and businesses earn more, and federal revenue from taxes increases.</p>

        The visualization was created using the {% include ffg/data-sources/current_mts.html %} as the data source for federal government revenue of the United States. Gross domestic product (GDP) figures come from the {% include ffg/data-sources/bea_gdp.html %}. The revenue-to-gross domestic product ratio is included to provide you with context for the trillions of dollars that come in to the federal government annually. Throughout this page, we use the gross domestic product for the Fiscal Year, not the Calendar Year, in order to facilitate an appropriate comparison.
