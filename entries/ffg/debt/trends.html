From 2008 to 2012 federal debt as a percent of gross domestic product increased to 99% and has remained above 100% since 2016. By the end of 2018 the ratio stood at 104%."/>

According to the most recent <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/financial-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Financial Report of the United States Government (FR)</a>, the current fiscal policy is not sustainable.</p>
