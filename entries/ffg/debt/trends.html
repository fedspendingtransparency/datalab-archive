        <p>The U.S. has steadily increased the federal debt since 2000, with a more rapid increase from 2009 to 2012 because of the financial crisis and ensuing recession. Another way to view the federal debt over time is to look at the ratio of federal debt related to gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>According to the most recent <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/financial-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Financial Report of the United States Government (FR)</a>, throughout the history of the United States the debt to gross domestic product ratio has tended to increase during periods of war or recession and decreased during peace-time or economic recovery. However current trends have not followed the pattern of decreasing the debt to gross domestic product ratio as the country recovers from the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The FR also states that current fiscal policy is not sustainable.</p>
