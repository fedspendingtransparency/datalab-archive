    <h1>Breakdown of the Federal Government's Debt</h1>

    <p class="debt-analysis-intro">What does the U.S. government's debt look like? Similar to people with a credit card, mortgage, or car loan, the federal debt consists of different parts. See some of the characteristics of the federal debt and how they have changed over time.</p>

                <h1 class="card__heading">How much does it cost to maintain the federal debt?</h1>
                <img src="/assets/ffg/debt/analysis/debt-to-interest-expense.svg" alt="Federal debt has increased steadily from $10.0 trillion in 2008 to $22.7 trillion in 2019. Interest expense varied some from 2008 to 2015 but has increased consistently from $402 billion in 2015 to $573 billion in 2019." class="card__image">
                Interest expense is what the government pays to investors who loan money to the government. How much the government pays in interest depends on:
                <ul>
                    <li>the total federal debt; and</li>
                    <li>the interest rate investors charge when they loan money to the federal government.</li>
                </ul>
                Although the total federal debt of the U.S. has increased every year over the past ten years, interest expense has remained fairly stable.

                <h1 class="card__heading">How have interest rates on the federal debt changed?</h1>
                <img src="/assets/ffg/debt/analysis/debt-to-interest-rate.svg" alt="Similarly, even though federal debt has more than doubled since 2008, the average interest rate on federal debt has decreased from 4.2% in 2008 to 2.5% in 2019." class="card__image">
                Interest rates have steadily fallen over the past ten years. Low interest rates are the reason for the interest expense the federal government pays on its debt remaining stable, even as the federal debt has increased.
