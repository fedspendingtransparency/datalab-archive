            <div class="accordion__content">
                <p>Well, a lot. The government buys a variety of products and services used to serve the public - everything from military aircraft, construction and highway maintenance equipment, buildings, and livestock, to research, education, and training. These types of final goods and services purchased by the government are classified as Object Classes.</p>

            <h1 class="accordion__heading">What are mandatory and discretionary spending?</h1>
            <div class="accordion__content">
                <p>The difference between mandatory and discretionary spending relates to whether spending is dictated by prior law or voted on in the annual appropriations process. Programs like Social Security, Medicare, and various income security programs, are based on laws previously established that dictate the money budgeted for spending each year, which is why spending for those programs is referred to as mandatory.</p>
                <p>Discretionary spending is money formally approved by the President and voted on by Congress during the appropriations process each year. Generally, a majority of the discretionary spending is budgeted towards national defense. The rest of discretionary spending is budgeted to other federal agency programs ranging from transportation, education, housing, social service programs, as well as science and environmental organizations.</p>

            <h1 class="accordion__heading">What does the future of Social Security and Medicare look like?</h1>
            <div class="accordion__content">
                <p>Each year, the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees publish their <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TRSUM/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Annual Report</a> on the financial status of Social Security and Medicare.  The Boards’ projections indicate that spending will continue to increase.  As the average age of Americans increases, more funding is needed to support entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and retirement and disability services for both military and civil servants. In 2017, the cost of the Social Security and Medicare programs was $1.7 trillion.</p>
                <p>The majority of Social Security and Medicare funding comes from tax revenue and interest on trust fund reserves. For 2017, income for these programs was also $1.7 trillion. However, starting in 2018, costs for Social Security and Medicare Part A are expected to exceed revenue and will require the federal government to begin drawing down trust fund balances in order to continue paying full benefits. While Medicare Parts B and D are largely funded by general revenues and beneficiary premiums, the Boards project that Medicare Part A trust fund will be depleted by 2026 and the Social Security trust fund will be depleted by 2034.</p>
