            <div class="accordion__content">
                <p>Well, a lot. The government buys a variety of products and services used to serve the public. Everything from the purchase of military aircraft, construction and highway maintenance equipment, buildings, livestock, to paying for research and educational and training services. These types of goods and services purchased by the government are classified as an Object Class.</p>

            <h1 class="accordion__heading">What contributes to national defense spending?</h1>
            <div class="accordion__content">
                <p>Along with paying for procurement and operational costs, the Department of Defense has the largest workforce in the United States, employing as many people as Walmart and Amazon combined! The Department of Defense pays the salaries of both the active duty and civilian workforce.</p>

            <h1 class="accordion__heading">What are mandatory and discretionary spending?</h1>
            <div class="accordion__content">
                <p>The difference between mandatory and discretionary spending comes down to whether spending for a certain purpose is dictated by prior law or voted on in the annual appropriations process.  Programs like Social Security, Medicare and various income security programs, are based on laws previously established that dictate the money budgeted for spending each year, which is why spending for those programs is referred to as mandatory.</p>
                <p>Discretionary spending is money formally approved by the President and voted on by Congress during the appropriations process each year. Most of the discretionary spending is budgeted towards national defense. The rest of discretionary spending is budgeted to other federal agency programs ranging from transportation, education, housing and social service programs, to science and environmental organizations.</p>
