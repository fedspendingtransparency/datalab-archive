            <p>Where does all the money go? The government spends money on a variety of programs to promote the well-being of Americans. Why does the federal government do this? The Constitution provides an answer! The Constitution’s preamble states that the purpose of our government is “…to establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.”</p>

                    <h1>In Fiscal Year 2018, federal spending was equal to 20% of the total gross domestic product (GDP), or economic activity, of the United States that year ($20.7 trillion).</h1>
                    
                    <p>Why do we compare federal spending to gross domestic product? One reason is to give a reference point for the size of the federal government, as measured by the amount it spends. U.S. gross domestic product is much larger than government spending, because it includes all the economic activity of the entire nation. Government spending equates to roughly $1 out of every $5 of the goods produced and services provided in the United States.</p>

        <p>How much is $4.1 trillion in federal spending?  If you divide it by the U.S. population estimate in 2018, 327.7 million (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/" target="_blank">U.S. Census Bureau</a>), it would equate to a little more than $12,500 in federal spending for every individual.</p>

        <p><strong>Gross domestic product (GDP)</strong> measures the size of the nation's economy by the total value of goods and services that are produced in a year. Gross domestic product is used to compare the economies of different countries, measure growth in the economy, and determine the right monetary policies to address inflation and unemployment.</p>

The spending-to-gross domestic product ratio is included to provide you with context for the trillions of dollars that go out from the federal government annually.
