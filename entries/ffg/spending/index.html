            <p>Where does all the money go? The government spends money on a variety of programs to promote the well-being of Americans. Why does the federal government do this? The Constitution provides an answer! The Constitution’s preamble states that the purpose of our government is “…to establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.”</p>

                    <h1>In Fiscal Year {{site.data.object_mapping.current_fy.value}}, federal spending was equal to {{site.data.object_mapping.spending_percent_gdp.value}} of the total gross domestic product (GDP), or economic activity, of the United States that year ({{site.data.object_mapping.current_fy_gdp.value}}).</h1>

                    <p>Why do we compare federal spending to gross domestic product? One reason is to give a reference point for the size of the federal government, as measured by the amount it spends. U.S. gross domestic product is much larger than government spending, because it includes all the economic activity of the entire nation. Government spending equates to roughly {{site.data.object_mapping.spending_proportion.value}} of the goods produced and services provided in the United States.</p>

The spending-to-gross domestic product ratio is included to provide you with context for the trillions of dollars that go out from the federal government annually. Throughout this page, we use the gross domestic product for the Fiscal Year, not the Calendar Year, in order to facilitate an appropriate comparison.</p>
