        <p>The visualization was created using the <a href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/mts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS)</a> as the data source for federal government spending of the United States. Some categories from the MTS have been renamed in order to be more easily understood. <a href="https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?bls" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)</a> was used to adjust spending in fiscal years 2014-2017 for inflation. Adjusting for inflation allows users to see real, not nominal, changes in sources of spending over time.</p>
