        <p>The visualization was created using the <a href="{{site.data.object_mapping_2018.country_comparison_mts.value}}" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS)</a> as the data source for federal government spending of the United States. Gross domestic product (GDP) figures come from the <a href="{{site.data.object_mapping_2018.bea_gdp.value}}" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)</a>.

        <ul>
            <li>the number of countries with {{site.data.object_mapping_2018.country_compare_year.value}} data,</li>

        <p>Countries with figures before {{site.data.object_mapping_2018.country_compare_year.value}} were excluded from the country comparison data set. Although most countries in the data set feature spending from central government sources only, some countries included state/provincial/local spending. As a result, this visualization should not be considered an absolute comparison of the spending of central governments for all countries.</p>
