    <aside class="deficit-aside">
        <p>The U.S. has experienced a deficit in each year since 2001, with a spike from 2009 to 2012 following of the financial crisis and ensuing recession, during which time revenue declined and spending increased. Beginning in 2016 increases in spending on Social Security, health care, and interest on federal debt have outpaced the growth of federal revenue.</p>

                        A surplus occurs when the government collects more money than it spends. The last surplus for the federal government was in 2001.

                    <div class="deficit--surplus__component--content deficit--surplus__balanced">
                        <img class="deficit__tabs-image" src="/assets/ffg/deficit/balanceBudget.svg" alt="" role="presentation" />
                        A balanced budget occurs when the amount the government spends equals the amount the government collects. Sometimes the term balanced budget is used more broadly to refer to instances where there is no deficit.

                        <img class="deficit__tabs-image" src="/assets/ffg/deficit/deficit.svg" alt="" role="presentation" />
                        A deficit occurs when the government spends more money than it collects. The federal government has run deficits for the last 18 years.
