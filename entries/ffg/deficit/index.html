    <h1>In 2018, the federal government spent $779 billion more than it collected, resulting in a deficit.</h1>

    <div class="debt-copy">
        <p>How did we end up with a deficit? A deficit occurs when the money going out exceeds the money coming in. Since the federal government spent $4.1 trillion and collected $3.3 trillion in 2018, the government ran a deficit for the year.</p>

            <p>How much is $779 billion in deficit spending? If you take the U.S. population estimate in 2018 of 327.7 million (U.S. Census Bureau), $779 billion would be equivalent to a little less than $2,400 in deficit spending for every individual in the U.S.</p>

                    <p>To pay for a deficit, the government takes on debt. The total debt that the government owes is essentially the accumulation of deficits over time, minus repayments of debt.</p>

                <p>The government can also use operating cash, which is available from an account at the Federal Reserve, to pay for deficit spending. This would be similar to an individual using their debit card to pay for purchases.</p>
