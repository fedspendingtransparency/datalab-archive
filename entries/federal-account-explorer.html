title: Data Lab - Federal Account Explorer – U.S. Treasury
excerpt: The U.S. Treasury’s Data Lab presents a tree-style visualization exploring nearly 2,000 federal government spending accounts and the amounts spent.
header: Did you know that the government has almost 2,000 federal spending accounts?
description: Federal accounts are what the government uses to spend money. We've created this visualization to provide an all-in-one view of these accounts and help you explore how much is being used. The dendrogram (tree diagram) shows how each agency's accounts are organized. The first branch of the diagram shows agencies, the second shows sub-agencies, and the third shows the federal accounts.

        <p>Federal agencies are responsible for spending these funds to carry out their programs and operations, which the Treasury Department assists with by managing the federal government's accounts.  All federal agencies have their own financial accounting systems to track money flowing in and out of accounts, and the Treasury Department is responsible for maintaining current and accurate information about the balances of agency accounts. This applies to accounts designated for paying individuals receiving Social Security, providing Medicare reimbursements, or paying for grants for roads and bridges.</p>"
